	Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage (PRF) is a weather-based index insurance program that uses rainfall as a basis for payout. It is provided through the US Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency (RMA)and is intended for grazing livestock and hay production. Grazing production is examined here. With the PRF policyholders will receive a payout if the amount of rainfall, according to an independent and government-measured index, for a given two-month period is below a chosen percentage of the average value for that period in the location of the policy. The percentage of average rainfall that could trigger a payout is between 75% and 90% of average rainfall, in 5% intervals, and is chosen by the policyholder in advance of the insurance year. These percentages are referred to as guarantee, or strike, levels. The government subsidizes premiums at rates dependent on the strike level, with the lowest level receiving 59% subsidization and the highest 51%. Higher strike levels increase premiums and decrease subsidies, but also increase the chance of payout. The degree to which a present index falls below the baseline average for a particular interval is taken into account when determining the amount of payout, i.e. an index of .3 pays more than .5. Therefore higher strike levels also increase the chances of larger payouts. The policyholder must also choose how to allocate coverage over the eligible time periods for each insurance year. Eligible time periods are, as mentioned, organized into two-month intervals. These intervals overlap such that the first includes January and February, the second February and March and so on. December and January do not overlap resulting in 11 intervals per year. 100% of the total coverage chosen by the policyholder must be split between these intervals, however consecutive intervals may not be chosen because that would result in insurance of the same month twice. It is advised, by the RMA, that the intervals in which rainfall is most important to forage production are chosen for the largest portions of coverage. For example, 30% coverage could be allocated to the March-April interval, 30% to May-Jun, and 40% to July-August. In many counties there are lower and upper limits to the amount of coverage that can be allocated to any one interval. 

	The precipitation index is derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center's (CPC)Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Daily Precipitation over the Contiguous United States. The analysis results in a consistently updated interpolated grid of daily precipitation from over 30,00 weather stations in the contiguous U.S., excluding Alaska and Hawaii.  The Risk Management Agency then uses the monthly-meaned variety of this dataset to create bi-monthly means and calculate indexed values based on average precipitation from 1948 to two years prior to the present insurance year. Each value is calculated for each bi-monthly mean of daily precipitation for each .25 by .25 decimal degree grid cell and bi-monthly interval. 

	This project examines how payouts would behave if the insurance program used any of a collection of alternate indices. Available alternate indices include the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSIsc), the Palmer Z-index (PDSIz, which uses a shorter-term data aggregation period), 1, 2, 3, and 6-month Standardized Precipitation Indices (SPI), 1, 2, 3, and 6-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Indices (SPEI), and the 1, 2, 3, and 6-month Evaporative Demand Drought Indices (EDDI). The baseline averages for EDDI can only be calculated back to 1980 due to data availability. Strike levels that trigger payouts are based on alternate index values with equal probability of occurance to the original rain-index, though value distributions differ. Alternate index values can be re-indexed to the bi-monthly means or not, depending on the options chosen. Any of the allowable strike levels, payout calculation periods, and baseline average calculation may be chosen. Most importantly, allocations of monthly protection may be altered, but will be calculated for each interval of each year, meaning that, when coupled with other static parameters, the results must be interpreted as payout potential and not as a simulation of possible insurance plan configurations.
